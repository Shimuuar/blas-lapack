High level binding to BLAS and LAPACK (not implemented yet). BLAS
(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix
operations.

Below is general overview of package:

  ## Data.*

Data types for different matrices and another type of vector. API is
modelled after @vector@ package.

  ## Numeric.BLAS

API for immutable vectors and matrices.

  ## Numeric.BLAS.Mutable.*

Thin wrapper over BLAS calls. It only insulates from raw pointers.
Otherwise it's same BLAS.
